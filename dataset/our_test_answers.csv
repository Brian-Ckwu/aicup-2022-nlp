106,"""Within the community of Christian believers there are areas of dispute and disagreement , including the proper way to interpret Holy Scripture . While virtually all Christians take the Bible seriously and hold it to be authoritative in matters of faith and practice , the overwhelming majority do not read the Bible literally , as they would a science textbook . Many of the beloved stories found in the Bible Â– the Creation , Adam and Eve , Noah and the ark Â– convey timeless truths about God , human beings , and the proper relationship between Creator and creation expressed in the only form capable of transmitting these truths from generation to generation . Religious truth is of a different order from scientific truth . Its purpose is not to convey scientific information but to transform hearts . We the undersigned , Christian clergy from many different traditions , believe that the timeless truths of the Bible and the discoveries of modern science may comfortably coexist . We believe that the theory of evolution is a foundational scientific truth , one that has stood up to rigorous scrutiny and upon which much of human knowledge and achievement rests . To reject this truth or to treat it as Â one theory among othersÂ is to deliberately embrace scientific ignorance and transmit such ignorance to our children . We believe that among GodÂ ’ s good gifts are human minds capable of critical thought and that the failure to fully employ this gift is a rejection of the will of our Creator . To argue that GodÂ ’ s loving plan of salvation for humanity precludes the full employment of the God-given faculty of reason is to attempt to limit God , an act of hubris . We urge school board members to preserve the integrity of the science curriculum by affirming the teaching of the theory of evolution as a core component of human knowledge . We ask that science remain science and that religion remain religion , two very different , but complementary , forms of truth .""","""Over 10,000 signatures of Christian Clergy have been collected , and have endorsed this letter ."""

Cesare Beccaria False is the idea of utility that sacrifices a thousand real advantages for one imaginary or trifling inconvenience ; that would take fire from men because it burns , and water because one may drown in it ; that has no remedy for evils except destruction . The laws that forbid the carrying of arms are laws of such a nature . They disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes . Can it be supposed that those who have the courage to violate the most sacred laws of humanity , the most important of the code , will respect the less important and arbitrary ones , which can be violated with ease and impunity , and which , if strictly obeyed , would put an end to personal liberty ... and subject innocent persons to all the vexations that the guilty alone ought to suffer ? Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants ; they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides , for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man . They ought to be designated as laws not preventive but fearful of crimes , produced by the tumultuous impression of a few isolated facts , and not by thoughtful consideration of the inconveniences and advantages of a universal decree .

Science is a methodology for investigating phenomena , not an enumeration of them . So it is perfectly possible to scientifically investigate , say , the power of prayer . Consider for a moment what you actually mean by 'materialistically ' : what is it that defines something as being material ? Gravity is every bit as intangible as a miracle , yet you would automatically characterise it as being part of the material world . Why ? The answer is that it is amenable to the scientific method : assertions about gravity can be repeatably tested . If ghosts and poltergeists were amenable to the same methodology , it would be possible to construct scientific theories concerning those , too , and they would be considered no more exotic or 'supernatural ' than clouds or rainbows . When you get your head around that , it 's immediately apparent that it is n't the power of prayer or spirituality per se that are n't scientific , it 's the methodology people have for dealing with them .

Unfortunately you ca n't have it both ways ; if you want to come to the party you have to adopt the dress code . Really , none of this would be a problem if science did n't have a ( from a religious perspective ) nasty habit of finding explanations for , or hidden and unexpected complexities within , features of the material world about which religious texts or leaders had already made firm pronouncements . Because despite the fact that you , SS , and others see science and evolution as an enemy of your philosophy and spirituality , the actual bone of contention is always in the material world .

A consequence of the gun ban in Britain is the repeal of their guarantee of a quick and fair trial . This bit of legislation basically allows a suspect to be held indefinitely without a trial or even being notified of the crimes he or she is accused of . For a very telling reason against gun control , I recommend you watch the UN Gun Debate between Rebecca Peters and Wayne LaPierre . Then , examine the international poll results online from the debate . Gun control kills . History has proven this over and over again . I know that some gun control advocates have the best of intentions at heart but what they fail to realize is that by opening that door , they allow those with less than the best intentions to take advantage of the situation .
