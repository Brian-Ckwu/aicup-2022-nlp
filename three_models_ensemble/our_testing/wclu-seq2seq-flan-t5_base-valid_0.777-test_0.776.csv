That's what one religious right outfit is suggesting. This week, Morality in Media disseminated a statement noting that the Iowa Supreme Court had legalized gay marriage on the same day that a gunman murdered 13 people in Binghamton, New York. The headline on the release :  Connecting the Dots : The Line Between Gay Marriage and Mass Murders.  The group's president, Bob Peters, notes that the  underlying problem is that increasingly we live in a 'post-Christian'society, where Judeo-Christian faith and values have less and less influence.  And, he continues, this  secular value system is also reflected in the'sexual revolution,'which is the driving force behind the push for 'gay marriage.''' Here's the punch line : It most certainly is not my intention to blame the epidemic of mass murders on the gay rights movement! It is my intention to point out that the success of the sexual revolution is inversely proportional to the decline in morality ; and it is the decline of morality ( and the faith that so often under girds it ) that is the underlying cause of our modern day epidemic of mass murders. That is, he's not saying that gay rights activists are directly responsible for the murderous actions of gun-toting madmen. But Peters maintains that those who champion gay rights are undermining the moral fiber of society and that this assault on traditional values creates an environment in which killing sprees can more easily occur. These acts of gun violence, he insists, are the poisoned fruit of the push for gay marriage. Talk about exploiting tragedy to advance an agenda.

Science is a methodology for investigating phenomena, not an enumeration of them. So it is perfectly possible to scientifically investigate, say, the power of prayer.

Gravity is every bit as intangible as a miracle, yet you would automatically characterise it as being part of the material world. Why? The answer is that it is amenable to the scientific method : assertions about gravity can be repeatably tested.

Ok, look, the ToE doesn't say that the possibility was ever there for random mutation to suddenly make wings appear out of nowhere. It just doesn't. The evolution of something as complex as a wing proceeds by a lot of intermediate steps, each one of them being useful, or at least associated with something useful. We don't see humans or dogs or alligators suddenly sprouting wings because that would require massive wholesale genomic, and probably epigenetic, change. What we do see are more mundane, less drastic variations which can accumulate over time. It's tempting to think  wings evolving from arms ; huh, what about the millions of years when they were neither ; how could they have been 'fittest '?  The mistake there is in visualising a straightforward morph from 'then'to 'now ', as if the organism knew where it was headed. A better way to imagine it is via an intermediate stage where the arms were still useful as arms, but also conferred an aerodynamic advantage, such as we see in flying squirrels today. If the original purpose of the arms later becomes less important, those features can atrophy while improved aerodynamic qualities remain strongly selected. The divergence of mice and bats is likely to have followed just such a pattern ; who knows, in another ten million years we might see descendents of flying squirrels that are as adept in the air as bats are today.
