They don't have a maternity ward at Planned Parenthood because they aren't a hospital, and you can go to your own hospital to have an ultrasound done, but if a clinic does an abortion themselves, they have to do an ultrasound first, to determine how far along the pregnancy is, because there are different procedures for different amounts of weeks.

But was confused when she started to like men. She actually thought that liking men was abnormal. Often he did not know if he too should like men, because he thought he needed to be with men. Not only that by he was ridculed by classmates because of his father being gay. Alot of children endure harassment because of living in a house made up of parents of the same sex. Just because it did not happen to your son, dose not mean that it dose not happen. And your experience is only a fraction of 1 % of the experiences that children go through because of having gay parents. It is impossible to say that it dose not happen.

This is the same reason you have to have faith. Rational demonstration is useless when trying to show something without evidence or without rational demonstration, which is the case with your  unknowable, self-contradictory  idea of a god. This is why you MUST believe through faith, which requires no rational demontration. It's no secret why faith needs no evidence, it CAN NOT use evidence, it's the opposite of reason. Why do you think the term faith exists in the first place? Reason does fine with the rational world. You needed a word to fit the irrational. Otherwise, why would you need faith?

PZ was paid $ 1,200 for his interview in the credits. If money was a concern, they could have paid him $ 1,190 and given him a free reservation.

This time it's the proposed  Regulatory Czar  who will be coming to a vote this week in the U.S. Senate. His name is Cass Sunstein, and he holds some of the kookiest views you will ever hear. For starters, Sunstein believes in regulating hunting out of existence. He told a Harvard audience in 2007 that  we ought to ban hunting.  And in The Rights of Animals : A Very Short Primer ( 2002 ), he said : I think we should go further... the law should impose further regulation on hunting, scientific experiments, entertainment, and ( above all ) farming to ensure against unnecessary animal suffering. It is easy to imagine a set of initiatives that would do a great deal here, and indeed European nations have moved in just this direction. There are many possibilities. If that's all Sunstein believed, he would be dangerous and extreme, but not necessarily kooky. Unfortunately, when you look at WHY he wants to restrict hunting, this is where he goes beyond extreme. In Sunstein's world, animals should have just as many rights as people... and they should be able to sue humans in court!

The two student gunmen killed 15 people and themselves before the SWAT team was in position. Commanders realized that it simply takes too long to assemble a tactical team in time to stop an active killer. The new tactics developed in response to Columbine involved creating an a diamond formation with guns pointing in all directions. This technique was employed by police departments around the country. Then 32 people were killed by a lone gunman at Virginia Tech in April 2007. Seung Hui Cho shot 47 people, 30 fatally, in the university's Norris Hall in just 11 minutes. That means every minute he killed more than three people and shot a total of four. Once again, the gunman continued shooting until a four-officer team made entry and then he killed himself. Law enforcement reviewed its tactics. Based on the Virginia Tech data, experts determined the first officer on scene should make entry immediately with an aggressive attack on the shooter. Every minute the officer waits for back-up, another three or more people could die. In other words, while it was once considered suicide for a lone officer to take on an active killer, it is now considered statistical homicide for him not to do so.

Malaika Brooks was driving her son to Seattle's African American Academy in 2004 when she was stopped for doing 32 mph in a school zone. She insisted it was the car in front of her that was speeding, and refused to sign the ticket because she thought she 'd be admitting guilt. Rather than give her the ticket and let her go on her way, the officers decided to arrest her. One reached in, turned off her car and dropped the keys on the floor. Brooks stiffened her arms against the steering wheel and told the officers she was pregnant, but refused to get out, even after they threatened to stun her. The officers - Sgt. Steven Daman, Officer Juan Ornelas and Officer Donald Jones - then stunned her three times, in the thigh, shoulder and neck, and hauled her out of the car, laying her face-down in the street. Brooks gave birth to a healthy baby two months later, but has permanent scars from the Taser. She sued the officers for violating her constitutional rights, and U.S. District Judge Richard Jones allowed the case to continue. He declined to grant the officers immunity for performing their official duties and said Brooks'rights were clearly violated.  It seems clear that Brooks was not going to be able to be able to be able to arrest.  It seems clear that Brooks was not going to be able to be able to be able in any way.

All facts are interpreted according to presuppositions, so it's only fair that Creationists should get to the table just like everyone else, right? Well, let's apply that same blanket reasoning to other situations and see what happens. Imagine a juror whose personal prejudices lead him to presuppose the guilt of a defendant based on her skin colour, and to interpret the facts of the case accordingly. Should he be allowed to sit in judgement? Of course not - but according to the reasoning presented by AiG that leaves us in an impossible position : by eliminating those jurors predisposed to return a guilty verdict based upon race, we necessarily cede the court to those predisposed to return an innocent verdict based upon race. Our intuition rightly rebels at this false dichotomy. We readily apprehend the existence of a middle ground wherein skin colour confers neither automatic guilt nor automatic innocence. Ah, but! Is that neutrality itself not merely another presupposition, another axiom through which the facts are being interpreted? One might protest that it is not, that the irrelevance of skin colour as a determinant of guilt can be determined empirically.
