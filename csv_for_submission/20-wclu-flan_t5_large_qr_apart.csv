Human ancestors were migratory pack animals. Where they went, they encountered new types of pressures, causing them to change over time. 2. Different selective pressures. Different areas can lead to different pressures. Some mutations also occured etc. Things like that. Evolution doesn't HAVE to occure non-stop if there is equilibrium. Not everyting is always changing, as far as I learned. Barring mutations that cause significant changes over a lot of time, Apes, Chimps, Monkies wouldn't really change all that much. There's no real pressure to do so. They are already well-adapted to their surroundings. Actually however, there really isn't that much difference between some of the great apes and Humans. Take the Bonobo Chimps, for example. They have 98 % the same DNA as Humans. They are the closest to HOmo Sapien. 3. Niches. Related to above. Crocs, for example, don't evolve that much because they are a very successful animal design and they found a place in which they can thrive for generations with little to no changes. Other animals can do the same. 4. As well, humans didn't come directly from Apes. We all evolved from a common ancestor who did all of the above. http : //www.talkorigins.org/faqs/homs/species.html Here is a time line of hominid species http : //www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-speciation.html http : //www.talkorigins.org/faqs/speciation.html Evolution doesn't lead to a more complex evolutionary history."""

( Note, this is copied from an older survey on abortion beliefs - a thread in the abortion forum called  Survey of views on abortion  ) : For me, the question of abortion rights comes down to a balance between the rights of the mother and the rights of the fetus. On the side of the rights of the mother, there is a very important right to the control over one's own body and to not be forced to carry something as important and taxing as a pregnancy against one's will. Some may say that, in agreeing to have sex, a woman is agreeing to a pregnancy, but I strongly disagree. A pregnancy is a possible outcome of sex but only has a very small percentage chance if birth control is used. It would be like saying that you agree to be mugged if you walk in a bad neighborhood. The great majority of sex acts - for both married and unmarried women, religious or non-religious, conservative or liberal - are not done for the purposes of having children but are done for emotional and/or purely physical reasons. Pregnancy is the goal for only a minority of sex acts. So, women are not agreeing to a pregnancy when they have sex. In the case of unwanted pregnancies, it is a significant burden that they never agreed to. If they are forced to carry such a pregnancy, it would be a strong imposition against the rights over their own bodies. On the other hand, one has the rights of the fetus. What rights the fetus has depends on your belief system and priorities. For me, the most important thing when it comes to the rights of any human being is whether or not there is a mental existence - at least a mental existence that is based on a belief system.

On girl wondered if she was gay because her mother was with another woman. She felt that was normal behavior. And started to concider being with girls herself. But was confused when she started to like men. She actually thought that liking men was abnormal. Until others told her it is normal to like men. A boy had almost the same experience, he did not know if he too should like men, because his father did. Often he would fight back desires for females, because he thought he needed to be with men. Not only that by he was ridculed by classmates because of his father being gay. Alot of children endure harassment because of living in a house made up of parents of the same sex. Just because it did not happen to your son, dose not mean that it dose not happen. And your experience is only a fraction of 1 % of the experiences that children go through because of having gay parents. It is impossible to say that it dose not happen. If it dose not happen to a few, then thats fine. But the majority suffers, and that far outweighs the few that don't suffer because of having gay parents."""

The conditions under which evolution operated during the Cambrian/Vendian times were different from the conditions following that time in two main ways, and these differences can potentially account for the origin of the many animal body plans during those early periods and the lack of new ones since. First, 540 million years ago most animals were very much simpler ( fewer cells, for example ) than they are today, so changes to their developmental programs would have been better tolerated. The more complex any system is ( the more parts it has, and the more coordinated and well-matched those parts must be, etc. ), the more rigidly constrained and less amenable to a given magnitude of change it is. So the simpler developmental processes ( simpler adult-form end product, fewer interactions between developmental genes, etc. ) of early animals would have allowed for a 'large-scale'change to be incorporated into that animal's ontogeny, though if a change of the same magnitude were to occur today, it would be too disruptive to the complex developmental program and would be eliminated ( note that 'large-scale change'refers to the adult form : the actual change that caused that altered end result could be a typical small scale mutation, in an early developmental stage ). This it not to propose Goldschmidt's  hopeful monsters  that occur due to'macromutations ', but rather an intermediate position between that and the  only micromutations  view of gradualistic neo-Darwinism. And, as just mentioned, mutations in developmental processes ( even ones that resulted in'macromutations'in the adult form ) would have been more tolerated in the simpler animals that existed 540 mya than they would be in today's.

However, if the author had proven that the world is young, the most logical explanation would be that evolution occurred in a shorter span of time, for all of our scientific evidence points toward evolution. If the author had proven that evolution hadn't occurred, then the most logical explanation that some similar, natural process is the cause. But it is a great leap of faith to suggest that Creationism is correct. See, the author has made a mistake fatal in debate : he has attack his opponent's viewpoint, then stated that since his opponent is wrong, he is correct. But that is not true, for he has not provided any reason for us to believe that he is correct. I, for example, might be contending that a bunch of Vampires carried stones together to form the Earth, then used their magic powers to make those stones into our world today.

Dr Stanley Jaki has documented how the scientific method was still-born in all cultures apart from the Judeo-Christian culture in Europe ( Science and Creation ( Edinburgh and London : Scottish Academic Press, 1974 ) ). An orderly universe makes perfect sense if it was made by an orderly Creator. But if there is no creator, or if Zeus and his gang were in charge, why should there be any order at all? Loren Eiseley stated ( Loren Eiseley : Darwin's Century : Evolution and the Men who Discovered It, Doubleday, Anchor, New York ( 1961 ) :  ‘ The philosophy of experimental science...began its discoveries and made use of its methods in the faith, not the knowledge, that it was dealing with a rational universe controlled by a creator who did not act upon whim nor interfere with the forces He had set in operation... It is surely one of the curious paradoxes of history that science, which professionally has little to do with faith, owes its origins to an act of faith that the universe can be rationally interpreted, and that science today is sustained by that assumption. ’ C.S. Lewis also pointed out that even our ability to reason would be called into question if atheistic evolution were true ( God in the Dock ( Grand Rapids, MI : Eerdmans, 1970 ) pp. 52-53 ) :  ‘ If the solar system was brought about by an accidental collision, then the appearance of organic life on this planet was a result of a collision between two atoms.

A teen who was raised in a family of outdoorsmen and exposed to firearms in a responsible, constructive fashion would react much differently than a teen who's only exposure to firearms is his way-cool arsenal in Call of Duty. I think that much the same results could be obtained with exchanging the  gun  with a football. Putting a dozen or so 18-22 y.o. in a room with nothing but a football would ensure that an athletic pecking order would be established very quickly. Domineering males would be throwing the football around in a competitive, even punishing fashion, submissive males would be cowering, hoping nobody throws the ball to them. Elevated testosterone levels would be expected in both ; some from competition and some from fight / flight... Both groups would exhibit the  aggressive  behavior the study offers for diametrically opposite reasons. This effect is compounded because of the anonymity ; the domineering would want to prove manhood and superiority and the submissives would want to inflict revenge,... especially if it is on an unsuspecting non-participant. I would go so far as to hypothesize that the submissives would put more hot sauce in the water than the  aggressive  domineering subjects.

6526,"""So how do creationists account for this : ERVs in humans match those in apes. ERV = useless code in DNA, but present in all members of a species Basically it goes like this. Viruses inject their DNA into the hosts DNA. This means that if the cell is able to replicate itself, it also replicates the viral DNA. As we all accept, creationists as well, sometimes things go wrong during this replication process. Sometimes, the viral DNA is rendered inactive. This is inconsequential as the cell dies and the error dies with it. But sometimes, this can happen to sperm cells that just happen to end up fertilizing. Therefore, the organism that is born from the fertilized egg carries this viral error ( ERV ) permanently and then passes it on. Since we can sequence viral DNA and have sequenced the entire human genome, we can go hunting for these viral sequences that have actually been propagating for millions of years. This is testable, every human on the planet has the same ERV's each of which has resulted from a SINGLE little virus doing its thing at some point in our evolutionary history. For evolution to be false, and this is a golden opportunity for creationists to prove it false, you would have to see that in apes none of these ERVs are present and they would have their own unique set of ERVs. When we looked, we found them and in the exact right place out of billions of sequences. The only way this can currently be explained is with evolution. We have the same error in our DNA that all apes have. Each of these errors has a cause that we can trace to a single event.

In America, Galton's ideas were picked up by the biologist Charles Davenport, who in 1904 established Cold Spring Harbor laboratory on Long Island as a national center for eugenics research and policy planning.... Davenport created a Eugenics Records Office and recruited an ambitious young high school teacher named Harry Laughlin to join him in an enormous project that sent fieldworkers across the country to identify the  germ-plasm  of unfit family strains so that it could be eradicated. Laughlin became an influential developer of American compulsory sterilization policy, which had officially begun in 1907 when Indiana passed a law allowing scientists to use surgical methods to eradicate the unfit....He helped Congress formulate the 1924 Immigration Act, which kept out  inferior  people from Southern and Eastern Europe. Bruinius deftly plays up the contrast between the eugenicists'obsession with cold measurements of human value and their own messy lives, which were marked by disease and behavior that could have qualified them as unfit : Galton suffered from severe depression ; Davenport had one child who was sickly and another who was apparently dyslexic ; and Laughlin was afflicted with epilepsy.

This time it's the proposed  Regulatory Czar  who will be coming to a vote this week in the U.S. Senate. His name is Cass Sunstein, and he holds some of the kookiest views you will ever hear. For starters, Sunstein believes in regulating hunting out of existence. He told a Harvard audience in 2007 that  we ought to ban hunting.  And in The Rights of Animals : A Very Short Primer ( 2002 ), he said : I think we should go further... the law should impose further regulation on hunting, scientific experiments, entertainment, and ( above all ) farming to ensure against unnecessary animal suffering. It is easy to imagine a set of initiatives that would do a great deal here, and indeed European nations have moved in just this direction. There are many possibilities. If that's all Sunstein believed, he would be dangerous and extreme, but not necessarily kooky. Unfortunately, when you look at WHY he wants to restrict hunting, this is where he goes beyond extreme.

I have traveled to numerous cities ( LA, 'Frisco, NYC, etc. ) to photograph its buildings, culture, and people. The law regarding the carry and use of pepper spray does not make any sense to me. In all of these places, I am not legally permitted to carry pepper spray because of my age. In all three of these cities as in most states, it is illegal for anyone under the age of 18 to carry pepper spray. Aren't we the ones who need the most protection? I'm only 16, and I'm a little short and quite skinny. I seriously don't feel safe marching around the city sporting expensive and flashy camera gear, but I don't really have a choice. Some of the most interesting places to photograph are poverty stricken and usually unsafe. With child molesters, rapists, robbers, etc out there just waiting to take advantage of a minor because of his/her small size, wouldn't the carrying of pepper spray not only be legal but encouraged? I don't understand how any state could leave one of their physically weakest minorities so vulnerable. I can understand limiting the possession of knives and guns to minors, because those are both deadly weapons and, to be frank, some of my peers are numbskulls. But, both pepper spray and stun guns have been proven to do no permanent damage to the human body. By the time one is about 15, one is responsible enough to know not to spray someone because  he gave me a funny look ,  I don't like him , or employ its use in a fist fight.

The quote says it all. That attitude breaks many cornerstone laws regarding personal responsibility. Manufactures are NOT responsible for customers illegal activity. GM and Ford know that 100 % of all the product they sell will be used illegally. Everyone of their cars will be used to break speed limits. No one obeys speed limts, the only time speed limits are obeyed is when a cop is watching. Yet GM and Ford are not responsible for all the illegal activity of their products. Shifting the responsbility for enforcement breaks many traditions and laws regarding individual personal responsibility. When a customer breaks a law using a product, manufactures are not responsible, that goes for both guns and cars, or any product that is sold and used for criminal purposes. There certainly a lack of cooperation between the ATF and the NRA. They really should be working together. It takes two sides to make a conflict. The ATF is trying to single out gun manufactures to be responsible for policing customers. NO OTHER INDUSTRY is being held accountable like that.
