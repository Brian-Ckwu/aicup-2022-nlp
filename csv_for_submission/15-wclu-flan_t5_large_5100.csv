It was Germany's worst shooting since another teenage gunman killed 16 people and himself in another high school in 2002. Most of the slain students were found dead in the school and the gunman killed an adult outside the building as he escaped, regional police spokesman Klaus Hinderer said. '' He went into the school with a weapon and carried out a bloodbath,  said regional police chief Erwin Hetger. '' I've never seen anything like this in my life.  After the attack, the suspect fled the Albertville high school toward the center of Winnenden, a town of 28,000, Hinderer said, before police tracked him down. The teenager graduated from the school last year, police said. Witnesses said students jumped from the windows of the school building after the gunman opened fire. Concerned parents quickly swarmed around the school, which was evacuated during the incident. The man entered the school at 9:30 a.m. and opened fire, shooting at random, police said. Police said the suspect was dressed in a black. About 1,000 children attend the school, located in a suburb some 12 miles northeast of Stuttgart. In 2002, 19-year-old Robert Steinhaeuser shot and killed 12 teachers, a secretary, two students and a police officer before turning his gun on himself in the Gutenberg high school in Erfurt. Steinhaeuser, who had been expelled for forging a doctor's note, was a gun club member licensed to own weapons. The attack led Germany to raise the age for owning recreational firearms from 18 to 21.""","""Well isn't that interesting.

I have seen so many documents, on teens the are confused about their sexual orintation, because of living i the house with their gay parents. On girl wondered if she was gay because her mother was with another woman. She felt that was normal behavior. And started to concider being with girls herself. But was confused when she started to like men. She actually thought that liking men was abnormal. Until others told her it is normal to like men. A boy had almost the same experience, he did not know if he too should like men, because his father did. Often he would fight back desires for females, because he thought he needed to be with men. Not only that by he was ridculed by classmates because of his father being gay. Alot of children endure harassment because of living in a house made up of parents of the same sex. Just because it did not happen to your son, dose not mean that it dose not happen. And your experience is only a fraction of 1 % of the experiences that children go through because of having gay parents. It is impossible to say that it dose not happen. If it dose not happen to a few, then thats fine. But the majority suffers, and that far outweighs the few that don't suffer because of having gay parents. It is impossible to say that it dose not happen. If it dose not happen to a few, then thats fine."""

Believers include the rest, whose belief ranges from merely an intellectual assent that someone or something is out there to those like Lewis, Augustine, Tolstoy, and Pascal who have had a life-transforming experience after which their faith becomes the primary motivating and organizing principle of their lives. Freud came down clearly and strongly against the notion that there is  Anyone  out there. He described his worldview as secular and called it  scientific,  and he claimed that no source of knowledge of the universe exists other than  carefully scrutinized observation what we call  Therefore no knowledge, he said, can be derived from revelation or from intuition. He stated that the notion of the universe created by a being  resembling a man but magnified in every respect, an idealized superman, reflects the gross ignorance of primitive peoples.  He stated that no intelligent person could accept the absurdities of the religious worldview. Freud described the concept of God as merely a projection of the childish wish for the protection of an all-powerful father. He added that  religion is an attempt to master the sensory world in which we are situated by means of the wishful world which we have developed within us as a result of biological and psychological abnormality.  He concluded that the religious view is  so pathetically absurd and... infantile that it is humiliating and embarrassing to think that the majority of people will never rise above it.  Except for the brief time as a college student under the influence of a brilliant philosopher named Franz Bratano, a devout believer, when Freud wavered in his atheism, he stated that he remained an unbeliever all of his life.

Remember, the works which became the new testament were around for centuries before they were actually compiled into the Bible. And none of the originals still exist. Who knows what changes were made to the account of Jesus's life before they were finally compiled. For example, look at Matthew 10:34  Do not think that I came to bring peace on earth. I did not come to bring peace but a sword.  Doesn't sound much like Jesus, does it? It certainly doesn't fit into the picture that's generally painted of Jesus. In the end the New Testament was written and compiled by mistake prone people. Some may believe that it's the unadulterated word of God, but looking at the above passage it's also easy to believe that it's also the work of common people.

3819,"""The Hidden Agenda Behind Gun Storage Laws By David Kopel In Canada and Great Britain deceitful  safe storage  laws allow government invasion of gun owners  homes. These laws are all part of the gun grabbers  wholesale attack on private gun ownership. Responsible gun owners store their guns safely. For over a century, the National Rifle Association and other civic groups have done everything they can to encourage safe gun storage. Partly as a result, the fatal gun accident rate for both kids and adults has fallen to an all-time low. In spite of this, anti-gun politicians, and the anti-gun groups are working to turn  safe storage  into a tool for disarming the American public. Gun owners who think they have nothing to lose from a government takeover of gun storage should look at what has happened in countries such as Canada and Great Britain. There, gun owner apathy has allowed  safe storage  to become the platform for abolishing gun ownership for home protection, for invading the privacy and the homes of gun owners, and for attacking even the simple possession of firearms. Great Britain British gun owners have a long tradition of going along with government proposals for  reasonable  restrictions on their rights. But as many Britons found out too late, a restriction that appears reasonable on paper may become quite unreasonable in practice. British law merely mandates that guns be stored in  a secure place.  But Britain has a national gun licensing system, similar to the American system proposed by Sarah Brady of Handgun Control, Inc. Because most police administrators in Britain are intensely opposed to citizens owning guns, they use the storage law to make acquiring a gun license as onerous as possible. If you want to obtain or renew a gun license in Britain, two police officers will visit your home to scrutinize your gun security system. Although the law, even today, does not order guns to be locked in a safe, the police routinely compel gun owners to purchase safes -- sometimes two safes, the second one for separate storage of ammunition. A person buying a low-capacity handgun in the UK is required to have a minimum of two firearms""","""But we have an enumerated Constitutional RKBA . Apples to oranges ."""

Here is what I define evolution as : Evolution is a three part theory, we have : 1. Astronomical evolution - the big bang theory. Explains how the universe started. 2. Chemical evolution - explains how life supposedly came from non-life, or lifeless chemicals. 3. Biological evolution - explains how a single celled creature evolved into all the variety of life that we see today. Is that right?

Those e-mails involved communication among many scientific researchers and policy advocates with similar ideological positions all across the world. Those purported authorities were brazenly discussing the destruction and hiding of data that did not support global-warming claims. Professor Phil Jones, the head of the Climate Research Unit, and professor Michael E. Mann at Pennsylvania State University, who has been an important scientist in the climate debate, have come under particular scrutiny. Among his e-mails, Mr. Jones talked to Mr. Mann about the  trick of adding in the real temps to each series... to hide the decline [ in temperature ].  Mr. Mann admitted that he was party to this conversation and lamely explained to the New York Times that  scientists often used the word 'trick'to refer to a good way to solve a problem 'and not something secret.'''

The fact that the Bible does not equate the assailant's life with the stillborn's life is proof that the Bible does not count the fetus as a person. Further more we should have found replications of your contemporary translation since the copying of laws in the Middle East was widespread.

In America, Galton's ideas were picked up by the biologist Charles Davenport, who in 1904 established Cold Spring Harbor laboratory on Long Island as a national center for eugenics research and policy planning.... Davenport created a Eugenics Records Office and recruited an ambitious young high school teacher named Harry Laughlin to join him in an enormous project that sent fieldworkers across the country to identify the  germ-plasm  of unfit family strains so that it could be eradicated....He helped Congress formulate the 1924 Immigration Act, which kept out  inferior  people from Southern and Eastern Europe.

In America and elsewhere, enthusiasm for eugenics was broadly supported by elites.

This time it's the proposed  Regulatory Czar  who will be coming to a vote this week in the U.S. Senate. His name is Cass Sunstein, and he holds some of the kookiest views you will ever hear. For starters, Sunstein believes in regulating hunting out of existence. He told a Harvard audience in 2007 that  we ought to ban hunting.  And in The Rights of Animals : A Very Short Primer ( 2002 ), he said : I think we should go further... the law should impose further regulation on hunting, scientific experiments, entertainment, and ( above all ) farming to ensure against unnecessary animal suffering. It is easy to imagine a set of initiatives that would do a great deal here, and indeed European nations have moved in just this direction. There are many possibilities. If that's all Sunstein believed, he would be dangerous and extreme, but not necessarily kooky. Unfortunately, when you look at WHY he wants to restrict hunting, this is where he goes beyond extreme.

9231,"""A PRACTICAL MAN 'S PROOF OF GOD The existence of God is a subject that has occupied schools of philosophy and theology for thousands of years. Most of the time, these debates have revolved around all kinds of assumptions and definitions. Philosophers will spend a lifetime arguing about the meaning of a word and never really get there. One is reminded of the college student who was asked how his philosophy class was going. He replied that they had not done much because when the teacher tried to call roll, the kids kept arguing about whether they existed or not. Most of us who live and work in the real world do not concern ourselves with such activities. We realize that such discussions may have value and interest in the academic world, but the stress and pressure of day-to-day life forces us to deal with a very pragmatic way of making decisions. If I ask you to prove to me that you have $ 2.00, you would show it to me. Even in more abstract things we use common sense and practical reasoning. If I ask you whether a certain person is honest or not, you do not flood the air with dissertations on the relative nature of honesty ; you would give me evidence one way or the other. The techniques of much of the philosophical arguments that go on would eliminate most of engineering and technology if they were applied in those fields. The purpose of this brief study is to offer a logical, practical, pragmatic proof of the existence of God from a purely scientific perspective. To do this, we are assuming that we exist, that there is reality, and that the matter of which we are made is real. If you do not believe that you exist, you have bigger problems than this study will entail and you will have to look elsewhere. THE BEGINNING If we do exist, there are only two possible explanations as to how our existence came to be. Either we had a beginning or we did not have a beginning.

There are lots of excellent arguments going every which way, and many of them are objectively unresolved, such as the one pertaining to the onset of personhood. They are truly matters of opinion.
