5896,"""[ i ] ( Before reading this , please know that I make no value judgements on abortion . From my perspective , it is not right or wrong or good or bad ... It is what it is , regardless of how it is perceived or labeled . If you think it 's acceptable as the 'right to choose ' -- good for you ! If you abhor it as 'murdering innocent children ' -- good for you ! I am posting this information because it is something that I discovered recently while investigating various methods of birth control ... And I believe that many people are not aware of the information I communicate here . I was n't . Take it for whatever it 's worth . If the issue is important to you for any reason , I encourage you to do some research on the subject . ) The answer depends on the definition of 'abortion . ' According to currently accepted medical terms , 'pregnancy ' does not begin until the point of implantation of the embryo in the uterine wall . And 'abortion ' is the termination of a pregnancy . So , according to the currently accepted medical terminology , the answer is no , of course not ! However , if you define 'abortion ' as the termination of a physical entity that has been developing since the point of fertilization , then there is significant evidence to suggest that the answer is yes . And absolutely no evidence to suggest that the answer is no . The birth control pill has three primary functions ( as do most hormonal bc agents ) : 1 . The primary function of the pill is to prevent ovulation , but sometimes ovulation occurs while on the pill . 2 . A secondary function of the pill is to slow sperm down so that they do not reach the ovum in order to fertilize it , but sometimes the sperm does reach the ovum in time to fertilize it . 3 . The third function of birth control pills is to create a less hospitable environment for a fertilized egg to implant in the uterus , but sometimes the fertilized egg does implant in the uterine wall , as evidenced by a 'failure rate ' when women are on the pill . ( In other words , sometimes women get pregnant while on the pill , indicating that all three functions of the pill failed . ) It is widely recognized by pill manufacturers and within the medical/scientific community that the effects of the pill can and sometimes do arrest the development of a human embryo that has not yet implanted itself into the uterine wall by 'creating a less hospitable environment for the embryo . ' How often this happens""","""I know that sometimes when a woman is on the pill , and they happen to get pregnant anyways , it will cause you to miscarry ( not always , but sometimes ) ."""

This time it 's the proposed `` Regulatory Czar `` who will be coming to a vote this week in the U.S. Senate . His name is Cass Sunstein , and he holds some of the kookiest views you will ever hear . For starters , Sunstein believes in regulating hunting out of existence . He told a Harvard audience in 2007 that `` we ought to ban hunting. `` And in The Rights of Animals : A Very Short Primer ( 2002 ) , he said : I think we should go further ... the law should impose further regulation on hunting , scientific experiments , entertainment , and ( above all ) farming to ensure against unnecessary animal suffering . It is easy to imagine a set of initiatives that would do a great deal here , and indeed European nations have moved in just this direction . There are many possibilities . If that 's all Sunstein believed , he would be dangerous and extreme , but not necessarily kooky . Unfortunately , when you look at WHY he wants to restrict hunting , this is where he goes beyond extreme . In Sunstein 's world , animals should have just as many rights as people ... and they should be able to sue humans in court ! '' We could even grant animals a right to bring suit without insisting that animals are persons , or that they are not property , `` Sunstein said on page 11 of Animal Rights : Current Debates and New Directions ( 2004 ) . Well , that 's a relief ... he is at least willing to concede that animals are not persons ! But he would still have animals suing humans , apparently , with more enlightened humans representing the cuddly critters . Imagine returning from a successful hunting trip ... only to find out that you 've been subpoenaed for killing your prize . Who knows , maybe Sunstein would have the family of the dead animal serving""","""And to think : We actually got nut jobs like this in government postions ."""

And to be sure , there are some nuts who are politically active on the right who should probably be locked up for their own good . But there are plenty of nuts like that on the left as well . A Texas woman faces trial this month in Austin on charges she threatened to kill a government informant who infiltrated an Austin-based group that planned to bomb the Republican National Convention in St. Paul , Minn. , last fall . Katyanne Marie Kibby , 25 , was indicted in June by a federal grand jury in Austin . She is accused of retaliating against Brandon Darby , the community activist-turned-informant who helped federal prosecutors win convictions against Bradley Neal Crowder , 24 , and David Guy McKay , 23 . Prosecutors say the e-mail threat was made Jan. 10 . That was two days after Crowder reached a plea bargain with federal prosecutors in Minneapolis for his role in the plot to build Molotov cocktails and attack the GOP convention in September 2008 . Crowder and McKay were part of a group of activists that had gone to the Twin Cities to take part in street demonstrations . The FBI had infiltrated the group with Darby . Crowder and McKay built eight of the gasoline firebombs but didnÂ ’ t use them , a fact law enforcement officials credited to Darby . Members of the Austin protest community heaped scorn on Darby , saying he had betrayed longtime friends and colleagues . Kibby , who lives in Houston , is free on bond . If convicted , she could face 20 years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine . She could not be reached for comment . WhatÂ ’ s funny is that , even as this is going on , the left is all atwitter about some gun owners legally carrying their firearms to tea parties in accordance with their 2nd amendment rights . You hear about that endlessly on news outlets like MSNBC , but IÂ ’ ll bet KibbyÂ ’ s name has never been mentioned on the network . Not to mention CrowderÂ ’ s name or McKayÂ ’ s .

6048,"""MEXICO CITY Â– Guards and officials at a prison in northern Mexico allegedly let inmates out , lent them guns and allowed them to use official vehicles to carry out drug-related killings , including the massacre of 17 people last week , prosecutors said Sunday . After carrying out the killings the inmates would return to their cells , the Attorney General 's Office said in a revelation that was shocking even for a country wearied by years of drug violence and corruption . '' According to witnesses , the inmates were allowed to leave with authorization of the prison director ... to carry out instructions for revenge attacks using official vehicles and using guards ' weapons for executions , `` office spokesman Ricardo Najera said at a news conference . The director of the prison in Gomez Palacio in Durango state and three other officials were placed under a form of house arrest pending further investigation . No charges have yet been filed . Prosecutors said the prison-based hit squad is suspected in three mass shootings , including the July 18 attack on a party in the city of Torreon , which is near Gomez Palacio . In that incident , gunmen fired indiscriminately into a crowd of mainly young people in a rented hall , killing 17 people , including women . Police found more than 120 bullet casings at the scene , and Najera said tests matched those casings to four assault rifles assigned to guards at the prison . Similar ballistics tests linked the guns to earlier killings at two bars in Torreon , the capital of northern Coahuila state , he said . At least 16 people were killed in those attacks on Feb. 1 and May 15 , local media reported . Najera blamed the killings on disputes between rival drug cartels . '' Unfortunately , the criminals also carried out cowardly killings of innocent civilians , only to return to their cells , `` he said . Coahuila and neighboring Durango are among several northern states that have seen a spike in drug-related violence that authorities attribute to a fight between the Gulf cartel and its former enforcers , known as the Zetas . Mexico has long had a problem with investigating crimes , catching criminals and convicting people . Reports estimate less than 2 percent of crimes in Mexico result in prison sentences . But Sunday 's revelation suggests that even putting cartel gunmen in prison may not prevent them from continuing to commit crimes . Interior Secretary Francisco Blake said the revelation `` can only be seen as a wake-up call for authorities to address , once again , the state of deterioration in many local law enforcement institutions ... we can not allow this kind of thing to happen again. ``""","""So somebody try and tell us , that with stuff like this going on , that America still needs to overhaul its gun laws to bring them more in line with those of Mexico ."""
